그룹 집계를 사용해야하기 때문에 서브쿼리가 발생하는데 WITH 구문을 통해 가독성을 향상시키고 휴먼 에러를 줄일 수 있다.

**WITH를 통한 가독성 향상**
```
WITH MEMBER_REVIEW_COUNT AS (
    SELECT 
        MEMBER_ID, 
        count(*) AS REVIEW_COUNT 
    FROM REST_REVIEW 
    GROUP BY MEMBER_ID
)

SELECT 
    MEMBER_NAME, 
    REVIEW_TEXT, 
    DATE_FORMAT(REVIEW_DATE, '%Y-%m-%d') as REVIEW_DATE 
FROM 
    REST_REVIEW AS C
JOIN 
    MEMBER_PROFILE USING (MEMBER_ID)
JOIN
    (
        SELECT MEMBER_ID
        FROM MEMBER_REVIEW_COUNT 
        WHERE
            REVIEW_COUNT=(SELECT MAX(REVIEW_COUNT) FROM MEMBER_REVIEW_COUNT)
    ) AS D 
USING (MEMBER_ID)
ORDER BY REVIEW_DATE, REVIEW_TEXT
```
